                <p className='CreatorParagraph'>Well actually the right question is who am I? My name is Jo√£o Luiz Vieira, I'm a creative front-end developer / Web Designer, and i assumed this hypemind persona as a form of sharing my work to the world
                    i always wanted o have a plataform to show everyone my ideas, but i never found the right place, so I decided to create my own! Welcome to hypemind where we encourage you to think wayyy beyond the limits.

                <h1 className='CreatorTitle'>Why did i created Hypemind?</h1>
                <p className='CreatorParagraph'>My biggest dream is to inspire people, im so passionate about that feeling when the ideas are just popping on your head that everything makes sense, that my goal is to make people feel ispired and encouraje
                    everyone to explore more of their creative side, I really think that everyone has such unlimited potential and my biggest hope is to ispire them to go further, to imagine and create their own worlds, just like I'm so inspired by so many things

            <h1 className='CreatorTitle'>My Biggest inspirations</h1>
            <p className='CreatorParagraph'>I was always especially moved by music, Travis Scott is my biggest inspiration ever, but I also want to reach a level where i can ispire others just like kanye west od kid cudi ispired me, I have a very
            especial place for rap music in my heart, I grew up hearing these legends and i have them as my mentors, but I also really really love the creative collective MSCHf, they where my biggest inspiration for the creation of hypemind, street culture
            always got me in a way that was truly especial, but the way that they mash up that punk, anti-corporate aspect always left me speechless, and I have this flirtation with some punk ideals and this free-from-the-strings thoughts.
